    GUF® - Global Urban Footprint® v1 - EPSG:4326 (WGS84 / geocentric)

    The GUF® maps show two land cover categories (e. g. in a B&W representation): Built-up areas
    (vertical structures only) in black and non-built-up surfaces in white; in addition, areas
    of no coverage by theTSX/TDX satellites (NoData) are coded in grey (most parts of the oceans).
    The focus on two categories clearly highlights the settlement patterns, improving the ability
    to analyze and compare them with other built-up areas across the world, in an urban or in
    a rural context. Unlike previous approaches, the fully automatic evaluation procedure detects
    the characteristic vertical structures of human habitations are primarily buildings. In contrast,
    areas used for infrastructure purposes, like roads, are not mapped. This is why broad urban
    canyons or expanses of greenery within the cities are shown as white corridors and patches.

    no data value is 255.
